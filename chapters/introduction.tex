\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
This is the TL;DR of your paper. What's it about? why do we care?
If you have an acronym, you can use it like this \gls{ml}, and it'll only
expand itself once. The other times it'll just be the acronym itself \gls{ml}.
You can oveerride this with \acrfull{ml} or \acrlong{ml}.

You can also reference glossary terms like \gls{glossary-term-id}.

You should outline your contributions: we discuss the requisite background info in \cref{ch:background}
and the methods to do stuff in \cref{ch:methods}
